1. Feature Extraction: Open the Crystal\_Features\_\_Atomic\_Features.ipynb notebook to extract features from crystal structures and atomic properties. This notebook preprocesses the raw data and generates the feature set required for training the model.
1. Model Training and Evaluation: Open the BG\_Prediction.ipynb notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning model for band gap prediction. This notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
### <a name="_mm2sxrsrxe2m"></a>**Data**
The dataset.csv file contains the dataset used for this project. Each row represents a material with its crystal and atomic features, along with the target variable (band gap).
### <a name="_jyr9ojrumqg8"></a>**Example Usage**
**To run the project, follow these steps:**

1. Clone the repository:**git clone https://github.com/Deepayanbasu007/ML-Band-Gap-Prediction.git cd ML-Band-Gap-Prediction**
1. Open the Jupyter notebooks and run them step-by-step:
- Run Crystal\_Features\_\_Atomic\_Features.ipynb to generate features.
- Run BG\_Prediction.ipynb to train and evaluate the model.

  This plot shows that almost half of our structures are metals (zero bandgap). The bandgaps around 7 eV could be outliers, but we can deal with those in a later.
## <a name="_4hyy9kkbepfi"></a>**Observations**
- **Feature Importance**: The most significant features for predicting band gaps are [list of important features]. This indicates that [brief explanation of why these features might be important].
- **Model Accuracy**: The model achieves a good accuracy with an R² score of [value], suggesting that the features used are effective in predicting the band gap.
- **Potential Improvements**:
  - Incorporating additional features could further improve the model's accuracy.
  - Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters may also yield better results.
