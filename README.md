# ML-Based Band Gap Prediction

This repository contains code and data for predicting band gaps of materials using machine learning. The project utilizes crystal and atomic features to develop predictive models for material properties.

## Project Structure

- **BG_Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the band gap prediction model.
- **Crystal_Features__Atomic_Features.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for feature extraction from crystal structures and atomic properties.
- **dataset.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models. This file contains the relevant features and target variable (band gap).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


You can install the necessary packages using pip:
